# Working with Entitlement

Entitlement managementÂ is a technology that grants, resolves, enforces,
revokes and administers fine-grained access privileges. The Entitlement
Management component of WSO2 Carbon facilitates the management and
control of policies defined in XACML.

The key functions of this component are listed below.
