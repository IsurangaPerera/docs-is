# Logging in to an Application Using Google

This tutorial guides you through configuring Google and WSO2 Identity
Server (WSO2 IS) to enable users to log in to your application using
their Google credentials. In this tutorial, Google is configured as a
SAML2 federated identity provider (IdP) and a sample application called
"Pickup" acts as the service provider. Follow the instructions in the
sections below to set this up.

!!! tip
    
    Before you begin:
    
    1.  [Create a Google
        domain](https://www.bettercloud.com/monitor/the-academy/create-google-apps-domain-three-easy-steps/)
        .
    2.  [Download](https://tomcat.apache.org/download-80.cgi) and
        [install](https://tomcat.apache.org/download-80.cgi) Apache Tomcat
        version 8.\*.\* or higher.
    3.  Install WSO2 IS version 5.7.0. by downloading the
        [installer](https://wso2.com/identity-and-access-management/install/)
        .
    4.  Open the `           /etc/hosts          ` file, add the following
        entry, and restart your computer.  
        To avoid any IP address conflicts, ensure that this is the only
        entry for this IP address in the `           /etc/hosts          `
        file.
    
        !!! warning
            
                This step is only required if you wish to use a WSO2 IS sample
                application to try out this scenario. If you wish to use your own
                application instead, you can skip this step.
