# WS-Federation

WS-Federation (Web Services Federation) describes the management and
brokering of trust relationships and security token exchange across Web
services and organizational boundaries. WS-Federation is a part of the
larger WS-Security framework. For example, WS-Federation builds on the
Security Token Service (STS) by providing mechanisms that facilitate
interactions.Â In the WS-Federation Model, an Identity Provider is a
Security Token Service (STS).
