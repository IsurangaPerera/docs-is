# Configuring reCaptcha for Single Sign On

This topic guides you through configuring reCaptcha for the single sign
on flow. By configuring reCaptcha, you can mitigate or block brute force
attacks.

-   For more information on configuring single sign on, see [Configuring
    Single Sign-On](_Configuring_Single_Sign-On_) .
-   For more information on brute force attacks, see [Mitigating Brute
    Force Attacks](_Mitigating_Brute_Force_Attacks_) .

1.  Set up reCaptcha with the WSO2 Identity Server. For instructions on
    how to do this and more information about reCaptcha, see [Setting Up
    ReCaptcha](_Setting_Up_ReCaptcha_) .

    !!! note
    
        **Note:** To modify the filter mapping for reCaptcha, open the
        `           web.xml          ` file located in the
        `           <IS_HOME>/repository/conf/tomcat/carbon/WEB-INF          `
        directoryÂ and find the following filter. You can modify the relevant
        URL patterns if required.
    
        ``` xml
        <filter>
                <filter-name>CaptchaFilter</filter-name>
                <filter-class>org.wso2.carbon.identity.captcha.filter.CaptchaFilter</filter-class>
            </filter>
            <filter-mapping>
                <filter-name>CaptchaFilter</filter-name>
                <url-pattern>/samlsso</url-pattern>
                <url-pattern>/oauth2</url-pattern>
                <url-pattern>/commonauth</url-pattern>
                <dispatcher>FORWARD</dispatcher>
                <dispatcher>REQUEST</dispatcher>
            </filter-mapping>
        ```
    

2.  Start the WSO2 IS Server and login to the management console.
3.  Click **List** under **Identity Providers** found in the **Main**
    tab.
4.  Click **Resident Identity Provider** and expand the **Login
    Policies** tab. Then, expand the **Captcha for SSO Login** tab.
5.  Select **Enable** and enter a value for the **Max failed attempts**
    field. For example, if you enter 3, reCaptcha will be re-enabled
    after 3 failed attempts.

    !!! note
    
        **Note:** This value should be less than the number of failed
        attempts configured in the account locking connector.

6.  You have now successfully configured reCaptcha for the single sign
    on flow. If the number of failed attempts reaches the maximum
    configured value, the following reCaptcha window appears.
