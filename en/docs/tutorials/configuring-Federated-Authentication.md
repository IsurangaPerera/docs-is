# Configuring Federated Authentication

This topic includes information on how to configure federated
authenticators in WSO2 Identity Server.

!!! warning
    
    **Note:** OpenID 2.0 has been removed from the base product as it is now
    an obsolete specification and has been superseded by OpenID Connect. We
    recommend using [OpenID Connect](_Configuring_OAuth2-OpenID_Connect_)
    instead.
    

You can configure the following federated authenticators by expanding
the **Federated Authenticators** section followed by the required
subsections.

    More Federated Authenticators
    
    Some authenticators such as LinkedIn are not provided OOTB with WSO2
    Identity Server but can be downloaded from the [WSO2
    store](https://store.wso2.com/store/) and plugged in to work with WSO2
    IS. For more information on those authenticators and connectors, see the
    [WSO2 Identity Server Connectors
    documentation](https://docs.wso2.com/display/ISConnectors) .
