### What has changed in this release

The design architecture of the current data publishers in WSO2 Identity
Server (i.e. the `         analyticsSessionDataPublisher        `,
`         analyticsLoginDataPublisher        ` and
`         AuthenticationAuditLogger        ` ) have been deprecated and
changed in this release.The new implementation consists of event
handlers that subscribe to authentication events.
