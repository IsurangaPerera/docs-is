# Carbon Remote User Store Manager

Carbon Remote User Store Manager is a way of using a user store that is
already configured in a WSO2 Carbon product.

Consider a scenario where two instances of the WSO2 Identity Server are
configured. The first instance (IS1) has a
`         ReadOnlyLDAPUserStoreManager        ` (configured on OpenLDAP)
and the second instance (IS2) has
`         JDBCUserStoreManager        ` configured on OracleDB. To
expose the users in IS2 to IS1 through the
`         UserStoreManager        ` API, you can call the
`         UserStoreManager        ` admin service operations. WSO2 IS
has a standard implementation which uses the admin services. The diagram
below illustrates this scenario.
