# OpenID Connect

OpenID Connect is an **authentication protocol** that is a simple
identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol. It allows clients to
verify the identity of the end-user based on the authentication
performed by an authorization server, as well as to obtain basic profile
information about the end-user in an interoperable and REST-like manner.

OpenID Connect allows clients of all types, including web-based, mobile,
and JavaScript clients, to request and receive information about
authenticated sessions and end-users. The specification suite is
extensible, allowing participants to use optional features such as
encryption of identity data, discovery of OpenID Providers, and session
management, when it makes sense for them.

WSO2 Identity Server focuses on the following specifications.
